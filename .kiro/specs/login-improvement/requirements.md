# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature improves the existing login system to enhance security and follow modern authentication best practices. The current system uses cookies for both access and refresh tokens, but we need to change this to return access tokens in the response body while keeping refresh tokens as secure HTTP-only cookies. Additionally, we need to update the authentication verification logic to handle Authorization headers instead of cookies for access tokens.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to receive access tokens in the response body during login, so that I can store and manage them according to my security requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL return the access token in the response body with the format `{tokenType: "Bearer", accessToken: "jwtToken"}`
2. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL NOT set the access token as a cookie
3. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the response SHALL include the token type as "Bearer"
4. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the response SHALL include the actual JWT access token string

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security-conscious system, I want refresh tokens to be sent as secure HTTP-only cookies, so that they cannot be accessed by client-side JavaScript and are automatically included in subsequent requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL set the refresh token as an HTTP-only cookie
2. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the refresh token cookie SHALL be secure in production environments
3. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the refresh token cookie SHALL have appropriate expiration time
4. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the refresh token SHALL NOT be included in the response body

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to send access tokens in the Authorization header, so that I can follow standard HTTP authentication practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client makes an authenticated request THEN the system SHALL accept access tokens from the Authorization header in the format "Bearer {token}"
2. WHEN a client makes an authenticated request THEN the system SHALL prioritize Authorization header over cookie-based tokens
3. WHEN a client makes an authenticated request with a valid Authorization header THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user successfully
4. WHEN a client makes an authenticated request without proper Authorization header THEN the system SHALL return appropriate authentication error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the authentication verification logic to be updated to handle the new token flow, so that the system maintains security while supporting the new authentication method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the authentication filter processes a request THEN it SHALL first check for Authorization header tokens
2. WHEN the authentication filter processes a request THEN it SHALL fall back to cookie-based tokens for backward compatibility
3. WHEN the authentication filter validates a token THEN it SHALL ensure the token is an ACCESS token type
4. WHEN the authentication filter encounters an invalid token THEN it SHALL clear the security context and continue processing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the token refresh functionality to work seamlessly with the new token flow, so that I can maintain my authenticated session without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests token refresh THEN the system SHALL read the refresh token from the HTTP-only cookie
2. WHEN a user requests token refresh THEN the system SHALL return the new access token in the response body format `{tokenType: "Bearer", accessToken: "newJwtToken"}`
3. WHEN a user requests token refresh THEN the system SHALL NOT set the new access token as a cookie
4. WHEN a user requests token refresh with an invalid refresh token THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing API endpoints to be updated to support the new token response format, so that client applications can integrate with the improved authentication system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the login endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return tokens in the new format while maintaining backward compatibility
2. WHEN the refresh token endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return tokens in the new format
3. WHEN OAuth2 login success occurs THEN it SHALL follow the same token response pattern
4. WHEN any authentication endpoint is called THEN it SHALL maintain consistent response formats across all authentication methods

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system, I want to maintain backward compatibility during the transition period, so that existing clients continue to work while new clients can adopt the improved authentication flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN legacy clients send requests with cookie-based tokens THEN the system SHALL continue to authenticate them successfully
2. WHEN new clients send requests with Authorization header tokens THEN the system SHALL authenticate them with higher priority
3. WHEN the system processes authentication THEN it SHALL support both authentication methods simultaneously
4. WHEN logout occurs THEN the system SHALL clear both cookie-based and header-based authentication states
